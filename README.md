# Shannon's Juggling Theorem Visualizer
A script that draws a SVG of events in a juggling cascade to illustrate the Shannon's Juggling Theorem.

The is chart rendered by loading the main HTML file, **jugglingGanttChart.html**, in a web browser.
Chart drawing functions are defined in **jugglingVisualizer.js**, but you do not need to modify it in order to draw a chart.
To make your own chart, modify the example defined in **chartBuilder.js** to create chart objects that are passed into the drawing logic.
